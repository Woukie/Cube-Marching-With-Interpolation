# Cube-Marching-With-Interpolation
Unity application of the 3D cube marching algorithm. Give it a 3D float array and it will output data for a mesh. Really cool algorithm typically used for turning 3D volume data into polygon data, has a lot of uses like terrain generation. Commented a lot on it, taken directly out of one of my Unity projects.

This is a crude implementation of the algorithm at best. To improve, there is a way to "Weld verticies" to smooth corners and it would be pretty easy to generate a UV map with the mesh data as well, there are definitley more than 2 ways to improve this though.

I am not responsible for the lookup tables, I have no idea where they came from so I unfortunately cannot give credit for them.
